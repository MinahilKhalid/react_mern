        <h3>The first Bagel Shop opened in Endell Street, London in 1997.</h3>
        <p>
          The basement was converted into a bakery, the ground floor into a shop, the first floor an office with the owner living in the flat above. Now, all these years later we have over 50 outlets in Ireland and the UK at most major travel hubs. Find the shop thatâ€™s closest to you.

        <p>Whether toasted with jam, drizzled with honey or filled with lashings of cream cheese and salmon, bagels are a great source of energy enjoyed at any time of the day.</p>
        <p>
          Satisfy yourself throughout the day with our regular favourites, from smoked salmon and cream cheese to our mouth- watering Salt Beef Melt, or create your own combination from our selection of delicious fillings.
